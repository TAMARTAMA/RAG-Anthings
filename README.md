A robust and customizable RAG system that supports document ingestion, indexing, retrieval, and LLM-based response generation using the gemma3-4b model. 
The system delivers accurate, source-grounded answers and performs query expansion.
It integrates with the model through HuggingFace Transformers, applies model refinement through quantization, uses OpenSearch for efficient information retrieval, and incorporates a ranker model to improve answer accuracy. 
The backend is built using FastAPI.

The project focuses on optimizing the RAG pipeline for both speed and accuracy.
It leverages gemma3-4b and OpenSearch, includes additional optimization techniques such as quantization and strict resource management. 
The work includes evaluating multiple models, developing a Python backend, and deploying the system in a production-ready environment.
