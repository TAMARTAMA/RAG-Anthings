When the city refused to pay the rent for the apartment, the manÕs family sued the city in a state trial court claiming a right to such payment under both the state law and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The highest state court ruled for the family. Although the court decided that the family had no right to payment under the state law, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled the family to payment of the rent for the temporary apart-ment. In its opinion, the highest state court indicated that in several of its decisions it had found cities liable for compen-sation in similar situations on the basis of the due process clause of the state constitution. But the highest state court declined to base its holding on the state constitution because that issue had not been properly raised in the case. The city then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. Does the Court have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case?"]}

In this case, the mean is 150 * 0.76 = 114. Therefore, the mean is 114.\n\nThe standard deviation of a binomial experiment can be calculated as the square root of (number of trials * probability of success * (1 - probability of success)).  So, the standard deviation is √(150 * 0.76 * (1 - 0.76)) = √(150 * 0.76 * 0.24) = √27.36 = 5.23.
