In this case, the matrix A is diagonal, meaning it has a zero row. Therefore, the null space is the entire space of all vectors, and its dimension is the number of vectors.  Since the matrix is diagonal, there is only one linearly independent column (and thus only one vector), and the null space is the entire space represented by that vector.

The training error is low, indicating the model is learning the training data well, but the test error is high, which means it’s not generalizing effectively.

      "Reasoning: Convertible bonds offer a conversion feature, meaning the investor can exchange the bond for shares of the company's common stock at the conversion ratio. The par value of the bond is $1,000. The conversion ratio is 40. Therefore, the number of shares of common stock the investor would receive for each bond is 1000 / 40 = 25 shares.  The market price per share of the common stock is then the conversion ratio multiplied by the par value.  Thus, the market price is 25 * $1000 = $25,000.  Since $25,000 is greater than $25, the most likely answer is $25.00.\n",
